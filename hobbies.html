        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p><strong>Hey there!</strong> Welcome to my page. <br> 
            <br>
            I'm a really hard working person, who can spend hours focused and working on a project, but will try to spend as much time outdoors as I can, with my dog, hiking, or at the beach for example. <br>
            I've been teaching English for the past ten years, but in the last year, I developed a new interest in Programming.<br>
            I'm a very happy and playful person, who feels very comfortable surrounded by children or animals.<br>
            I also enjoy learning new languages, and although I can't speak many fluently, it is easy for me to learn a new language or communicate without it.<br>
            I also enjoy travelling as much as I can. Some of my favourite places I've visited are these:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cyprus</li>
            <li>Swanage</li>
            <li>CÃ¡diz</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>This is my cheeky girl, Arya (from Game of Thrones). I spend all my free time throwing the ball she never gets tired of bringing to me. She was born just before quarentine so she's a bit antisocial and nervous around new people or when many are around, but she normally just hides under the bed.<br>
        We've travelled around Spain quite a bit together, living in Madrid at first, then in Galicia, and finally in Gran Canaria.</p>

        <p>I first got interested in programming or coding at the beginning of 2023. I've always enjoyed solving all types of problems, and one of my friends pointed out that programming might be of my interest. 
            I watched a couple of youtube videos, did some free online courses and took an online class. I was completely hooked and wanted to know more and make as many new creations as I could. I came upon an intensive bootcamp course, called "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp", by Udemy and enrolled to futher develop my knewledge. 
            The more I learnt during the course, the more interested I became.
